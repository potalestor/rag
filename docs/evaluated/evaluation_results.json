        "response": "In the context of large language models like JetMoe-8B, \"Mixture of Attention Heads\" and \"Mixture of MLP Experts\" are advanced architectures designed to enhance the model's efficiency and performance by using specialized mechanisms to process information.\n\n### Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA)\n\nThe Mixture of Attention Heads mechanism aims to improve the model's capacity to focus on different parts of the input data dynamically. In traditional transformer architectures, each attention head has a fixed role and processes the input in a uniform manner. However, in Mixture of Attention Heads, the model can selectively activate a subset of attention heads depending on the input context. \n\n#### Key Functions:\n- **Dynamic Selection**: The model dynamically selects different combinations of",
